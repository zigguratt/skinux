# Skinux

As the description above says, Skinux comrises a set of scripts and files that provide an extremely minimal and aesthetically pleasing Arch Linux working environment. In the wiki I lay out how to install this system onto various targets, including a USB flash drive, and a virtual machine.

Whatever install route you choose, please enjoy your new, lightweight, powerful, portable operating system! You'll be putting a lot of work into setting it up, but it will be worthwhile. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions please open an issue and I'll do my best to address them. Sadly, I probably won't entertain suggestions to change window managers, themes, or task bars; that can be decided upon after the fact by anyone who installs this system.

I would like this to be the most minimal system possible whilst still enjoying a full graphical workspace experience so any suggestions as to how to make it more minimal are welcome. I would also love to hear of this being installed on non-Apple hardware, or of a successful reboot on a second system.
